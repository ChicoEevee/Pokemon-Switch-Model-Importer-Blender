# Pokémon Switch V3 Importer/Exporter Blender
A Python script for Blender to import/export models from Pokémon Games on Nintendo Switch. Should be working for 4.x and 5.x

Credits to [Shararamosh](https://github.com/Shararamosh) for the work and letting me add the animation importer to this addon.

HUGE thanks to Random Talking Bush for making the original maxscript for this https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-29836.html, slowly were doing a remake using flatbuffers so no more will be based on the RTalkingBush script. Thank you everybory who uses the blender addon.
