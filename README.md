# Pokémon Switch V3 Model Importer/Exporter Blender
A Python script for Blender to import/export models from Pokémon Games on Nintendo Switch.

Credits to Shararamosh for the work and letting me add the animation importer to this addon.

HUGE thanks to Random Talking Bush for making the original maxscript for this
https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-29836.html

The formatting of this script is a bit wonky, but that's because I wanted to make it
look as close to the original maxscript as possible.
That way, it's easier to compare the two and see what's different.
