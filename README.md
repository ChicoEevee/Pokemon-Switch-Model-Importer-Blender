# Pokémon Switch V2 Model Importer/Exporter Blender
A Python script for Blender to import/export models from Pokémon Games in Nintendo Switch.

Model Exports are still WIP currently you can only export skeleton as a json and you will need to convert it to binary with flatc and the schema from PkZukan/PokeDocs

HUGE thanks to Random Talking Bush for making the original maxscript for this
https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-29836.html

The formatting of this script is a bit wonky, but that's because I wanted to make it
look as close to the original maxscript as possible.
That way, it's easier to compare the two and see what's different.
